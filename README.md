## 🌍 Why Free Matters

Not everyone can afford expensive courses, certifications, or paid mentorships.  
Many talented minds, especially beginners, give up early because they can’t access the right learning materials.  
By making knowledge **freely available**, we’re helping remove those barriers and ensuring that **passion, not privilege, defines success** in cybersecurity.

## 🧠 Knowledge Should Be Shared, Not Sold

Cybersecurity thrives on **collaboration and community**.  
Every vulnerability report, every write-up, and every open discussion makes the internet a little safer.  
Sharing free resources means we’re contributing to a **stronger, smarter, and more secure ecosystem** — one learner at a time.

## 🚀 Building a Culture of Learning

The goal isn’t just to teach people how to hack — it’s to help them understand **how to protect, defend, and think critically** about security systems.  
With freely accessible resources, anyone can:
- Learn the fundamentals of ethical hacking  
- Explore bug bounty hunting  
- Understand real-world attack vectors
